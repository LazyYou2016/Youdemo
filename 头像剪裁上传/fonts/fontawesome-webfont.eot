-------------------- Known bugs and current work -----------------------

get_syn_options() does not respect skip in else part. (Zyx)

+channel:
- Try out background make plugin: 
  https://github.com/AndrewVos/vim-make-background
- Problem with stderr on Windows? (Vincent Rischmann, 2016 Aug 31, #1026)
- Add 'cwd' argument to start_job(): directory to change to in the child.
    check for valid directory before forking.
  Part of patch for environment, Yasuhiro Matsumoto, #1160
- When out_cb executes :sleep, the close_cb may be invoked. (Daniel Hahler,
  2016 Dec 11, #1320)
- Implement |job-term| ?
- Channel test fails with Motif.  Sometimes kills the X11 server.
- When a message in the queue but there is no callback, drop it after a while?
  Add timestamp to queued messages and callbacks with ID, remove after a
  minute.  Option to set the droptime.
- Add an option to drop text of very long lines?  Default to 1 Mbyte.
- Add remark about undo sync, is there a way to force it?
- When starting a job, have an option to open the server socket, so we know
  the port, and pass it to the command with --socket-fd {nr}. (Olaf Dabrunz,
  Feb 9)  How to do this on MS-Windows?
- For connection to server, a "keep open" flag would be useful.  Retry
  connecting in the main loop with zero timeout.
- job_start(): run job in a newly opened terminal.
    With xterm could use -S{pty}.

Regexp problems:
- Since 7.4.704 the old regex engine fails to match [[:print:]] in 0xf6.
  (Manuel Ortega, 2016 Apr 24)
  Test fails on Mac.  Avoid using isalpha(), isalnum(), etc?  Depends on
  LC_CTYPE
- The old engine does not find a match for "/\%#=1\(\)\{80}", the new engine
  matches everywhere.
- Using win_linetabsize() can still be slow. Cache the result, store col and
  vcol. Reset them when moving to another line.
- Very slow with a long line and Ruby highlighting. (John Whitley, 2014 Dec 4)
- Bug with pattern: '\vblock (\d+)\.\n.*\d+%(\1)@<!\.$'
  (Lech Lorens, 2014 Feb 3)
- Issue 164: freeze on regexp search.
- Ignorecase not handled properly for multi-byte characters. (Axel Bender,
  2013 Dec 11)
- Using \@> and \?. (Brett Stahlman, 2013 Dec 21) Remark from Marcin
  Szamotulski; Remark from Brett 2014 Jan 6 and 7.
- NFA regexp doesn't handle \%<v correctly. (Ingo Karkat, 2014 May 12)
- Does not work with NFA regexp engine:
  \%u, \%x, \%o, \%d followed by a composing character
- Search for \%d0\+ may fail with E363. (Christian Brabandt, 2016 Oct 4)
- \%'[ does not work.  '%'] does work.  (Masaaki Nakamura, 2016 Apr 4)
- Bug relating to back references. (Ingo Karkat, 2014 Jul 24)
- New RE does not give an error for empty group: "\(\)\{2}" (Dominique Pelle,
  2015 Feb 7)
- Using back reference before the capturing group sometimes works with the old
  engine, can we do this with the new engine?  E.g. with
  "/\%(<\1>\)\@<=.*\%(<\/\(\w\+\)>\)\@=" matching text inside HTML tags.
  This problem is probably the same: "\%(^\1.*$\n\)\@<=\(\d\+\).*$".
  (guotuofeng, 2015 Jun 22)
- Strange matching with "\(Hello\n\)\@<=A". (Anas Syed, 2015 Feb 12)
- Problem with \v(A)@<=b+\1c. (Issue 334)
- Diff highlighting can be very slow. (Issue 309)
- Using %> for a virtual column has a check based on 'tabsize'.  Better would
  be to cache the result of win_linetabsize(col), storing both col and vcol,
  and use them to decide whether win_linetabsize() needs to be called.  Reset
  col and vcol when moving to another line.
- this doesn't work: "syntax match ErrorMsg /.\%9l\%>20c\&\%<28c/".  Leaving
  out the \& works.  Seems any column check after \& fails.
- The pattern "\1" with the old engine gives E65, with the new engine it
  matches the empty string. (Dominique Pelle, 2015 Oct 2, Nov 24)
  had_endbrace[] is set but not initialized or used.
- Difference between two engines: ".*\zs\/\@>\/" on text "///"
  (Chris Paul, 2016 Nov 13)  New engine not greedy enough?

Json string with trailing \u should be an error. (Lcd)

set_color_count().

Python: ":py raw_input('prompt')" doesn't work. (Manu Hack)

Comparing nested structures with "==" uses a different comparator than when
comparing individual items.
Also, "'' == 0" evaluates to true, which isn't nice.
Add "===" to have a strict comparison (type and value match).
Add "==*" (?) to have a value match, but no automatic conversion, and v:true
equals 1 and 1.0, v:false equals 0 and 0.0.?

Value returned by virtcol() changes depending on how lines wrap.  This is
inconsistent with the documentation.

Can we cache the syntax attributes, so that updates for 'relativenumber' and
'cursorline'/'cursorcolumn' are a lot faster?

C highlighting: modern C allows: /* comment */ #ifdef
and also line continuation after #include.
I can't recommend it though.

Build with Python on Mac does not always use the right library.

MS-Windows: Crash opening very long file name starting with "\\".
(Christian Brock, 2012 Jun 29)

Using an external diff is inefficient.  Not all systems have a good diff
program available (esp. MS-Windows).  Would be nice to have in internal diff
implementation.  Can then also use this for displaying changes within a line.
Olaf Dabrunz is working on this.

The OptionSet autocommand event is not always triggered. (Rick Howe, 2015 Sep
24): :diffthis, :diffoff.

":set all&" still does not handle all side effects.  Centralize handling side
effects for when set by the user, on init and when reset to default.

":tag" does not jump to the right entry of a :tselect. (James Speros, 2015 Oct
9)

The argument for "-S" is not taken literally, the ":so" command expands

Proposal to make options.txt easier to read. (Arnaud Decara, 2015 Aug 5)
Update Aug 14.

When using --remote-tab on MS-Windows 'encoding' hasn't been initialized yet,
the file name ends up encoded wrong. (Raul Coronado, 2015 Dec 21)

Patch for problem with restoring screen on Windows. (Nobuhiro Takasaki, 2015
Sep 10)

Example in editing.txt uses $HOME with the expectation that it ends in a
slash.  For me it does, but perhaps not for everybody.  Add a function that
inserts a slash when needed?  pathconcat(dir, path) (Thilo Six, 2015 Aug 12)

ml_updatechunk() is slow when retrying for another encoding. (John Little,

Patch for multi-byte characters in langmap and applying a mapping on them.
(Christian Brabandt, 2015 Jun 12, update July 25)
Is this the right solution?  Need to cleanup langmap behavior:
- in vgetorpeek() apply langmap to the typeahead buffer and put the result in
  a copy-buffer, only when langmap is appropriate for the current mode. Then
  check for mapping and let gotchars() work on the copy-buffer.
- Remove LANGMAP_ADJUST() in other parts of the code.  Make sure the mode is
  covered by the above change.
So that replaying the register doesn't use keymap/langmap and still does the
same thing.  Remarks on issue 543 (Roland Puntaier).
Also see #737: langmap not applied to replaying recording.

Patch to add grepfile(). (Scott Prager, 2015 May 26)
Work in progress.

Would be useful to have a treemap() or deepmap() function.  Like map() but

Issue #459.

When a session file is created and there are "nofile" buffers, these are not

Patch for glob(), adding slash to normal files. (Ingo Karkat, 2014 Dec 22)

When entering and leaving the preview window autocommands are triggered, but
these may not work well.  Perhaps set a flag to indicate that the preview
window is involved? (John Otter, 2015 Oct 27)

Using "." to repeat an Ex command puts that command in history.  Probably
should not happen.  If the command is the result of a mapping it's not put in
history either. (Jacob Niehus, 2014 Nov 2)

"hi link" does not respect groups with GUI settings only. (Mark Lodato, 2014

Spell files use a latin single quote. Unicode also has another single quote:
0x2019.  (Ron Aaron, 2014 Apr 4)
New OpenOffice spell files support this with ICONV.  But they are not
compatible with Vim spell files.  The old files can no longer be downloaded.

xterm should be able to pass focus changes to Vim, so that Vim can check for
buffers that changed.  Perhaps in misc.c, function selectwindow().
Xterm 224 supports it!
Patch to make FocusGained and FocusLost work in modern terminals. (Hayaki
Saito, 2013 Apr 24) Update 2016 Aug 12.
Also see issue #609.
We could add the enable/disable sequences to t_ti/t_te or t_ks/t_ke.

Idea: For a window in the middle (has window above and below it), use
right-mouse-drag on the status line to move a window up/down without changing
its height?  It's like dragging the status bar above it at the same time.

This neither: (ZyX)
    vim -u NONE 1 2 3 -c 'bufdo while 1 | echo 1'

'viewdir' default on MS-Windows is not a good choice, it's a system directory.
Change 'viewdir' to "$HOME/vimfiles/view" and use 'viewdiralt' to also read
from?

Problem with upwards search on Windows (works OK on Linux). (Brett Stahlman,
2014 Jun 8)

Include a plugin manager with Vim? Neobundle seems to be the best currently.
Also Vundle: https://github.com/gmarik/vundle
Long message about this from ZyX, 2014 Mar 23.  And following replies.
Also see http://vim-wiki.mawercer.de/wiki/topic/vim%20plugin%20managment.html
User view:
- Support multiple sources, basically any http:// URL. Or a central place that
  will work for everybody (github?  redirects from vim.org?).
  Be able to look into the files before deciding to install.
- Be able to try out a plugin and remove it again with (almost) no traces.
- Each plugin needs a "manifest" file that has the version, dependencies
  (including Vim version and features), conflicts, list of files, etc.
  Updater uses that to decide what/how to update.
  Dependencies can use a URL for specific versions, or short name for scripts
  on vim.org.
- Once a plugin is installed it remembers where it came from, updater checks
  there.  Can manually update when really needed.
- Must be possible to install for one user.  Also system wide?
- Can edit plugin config with Vim. Can temporarily disable a plugin.
- Run the update manually, find latest version and install.
- Be able to download without special tools, must work for 95% of users.
Implementation:
- Avoid the 'runtimepath' getting long.  Need some other way to keep each
  plugin separate.
- When installing or updating, first figure out what needs to be done. This
  may involve recursively fetching manifest files for dependencies.  Then show
  the user what's going to change and ask for OK.
- Scripts on Vim.org must be able to consist of several files.  Is zip format
  sufficient?  Upload the manifest?  Or refer to a site that has the manifest?
- Best is to fetch individual files or use a Vimball. Reduces dependency on
  tools that might be missing and allows inspection of the files before
  installing.
Out of scope:
- Overview of plugins, ratings, comments, etc.  That's another world.
- Development work on plugins (although diff with distributed version would be
  useful).

Patch for GTK buttons X1Mouse and X2Mouse. (Christian J. Robinson, 2010 Aug 9)

Motif: Build on Ubuntu can't enter any text in dialog text fields.

":tab split fname" doesn't set the alternate file in the original window,
because win_valid() always returns FALSE.  Below win_new_tabpage() in
ex_docmd.c.

Space before comma in function definition not allowed: "function x(a , b)"
Give a more appropriate error message.  Add a remark to the docs.

string_convert() should be able to convert between utf-8 and utf-16le.  Used

Bug: When reloading a buffer changed outside of Vim, BufRead autocommands
are applied to the wrong buffer/window. (Ben Fritz, 2009 Apr 2, May 11)
Ignore window options when not in the right window?
Perhaps we need to use a hidden window for applying autocommands to a buffer
that doesn't have a window.

When using "ab foo bar" and mapping <Tab> to <Esc>, pressing <Tab> after foo
doesn't trigger the abbreviation like <Esc> would. (Ramana Kumar, 2009 Sep 6)

getbufvar() to get a window-local option value for a buffer that's not
displayed in a window should return the value that's stored for that buffer.

":he ctrl_u" can be auto-corrected to ":he ctrl-u".

There should be a way after an abbreviation has expanded to go back to what
was typed.  CTRL-G h ?  Would also undo last word or line break inserted
perhaps.  And undo CTRL-W.  CTRL-G l would redo.

Inconsistent: starting with $LANG set to es_ES.utf-8 gives Spanish

When $HOME contains special characters, such as a comma, escape them when used
in an option. (Michael Hordijk, 2009 May 5)
Turn "esc" argument of expand_env_esc() into string of chars to be escaped.

Consider making YankRing or something else that keeps a list of yanked text

After doing "su" $HOME can be the old user's home, thus ~root/file is not
correct.  Don't use it in the swap file.

Completion for ":buf" doesn't work properly on Win32 when 'shellslash' is off.
(Henrik Ohman, 2009, Jan 29)

shellescape() depends on 'shellslash' for quoting.  That doesn't work when
'shellslash' is set but using cmd.exe. (Ben Fritz)
Use a different option or let it depend on whether 'shell' looks like a

Maybe call it v:motiontype.

MS-Windows: editing the first, empty buffer, 'ffs' set to "unix,dos", ":enew"
doesn't set 'ff' to "unix".  (Ben Fritz, 2008 Dec 5) Reusing the old buffer

(Richard Sherman, 2009 Apr 12)

Having "Syntax" in 'eventignore' for :bufdo may cause problems, e.g. for
":bufdo e" when buffers are open in windows.  ex_listdo(eap) could set the
option only for when jumping to another buffer, not when the command argument
is executed.

":pedit %" with a BufReadPre autocommand causes the cursor to move to the
first line. (Ingo Karkat, 2008 Jul 1)  Ian Kelling is working on this.
Similar problem with ":e". (Marc Montu, 2014 Apr 22)

Cursor line moves in other window when using CTRL-W J that doesn't change
anything.  (Dasn, 2009 Apr 7)

On Unix "glob('does not exist~')" returns the string.  Without the "~" it
doesn't. (John Little, 2008 Nov 9)
Shell expansion returns unexpanded string?
Don't use shell when "~" is not at the start?

When using ":e ++enc=foo file" and the file is already loaded with
'fileencoding' set to "bar", then do_ecmd() uses that buffer, even though the
fileencoding differs.  Reload the buffer in this situation?  Need to check for
the buffer to be unmodified.
Unfinished patch by Ian Kelling, 2008 Jul 11.  Followup Jul 14, need to have
another look at it.

c.vim: XXX in a comment is colored yellow, but not when it's after "#if 0".
(Ilya Dogolazky, 2009 Aug 7)

You can type ":w ++bad=x fname", but the ++bad argument is ignored.  Give an
error message?  Or is this easy to implement?  (Nathan Stratton Treadway, 2008
Aug 20)  This is in ucs2bytes(), search for 0xBF.  Using the ++bad argument is
at the other match for 0xBF.

When adding "-complete=file" to a user command this also changes how the
argument is processed for <f-args>. (Ivan Tishchenko, 2008 Aug 19)

Win32: associating a type with Vim doesn't take care of space after a

":help s/~" jumps to *s/\~*, while ":help s/\~" doesn't find anything. (Tim
Chase)  Fix by Ian Kelling, 2008 Jul 14.

When mapping : to ; and ; to :, @; doesn't work like @: and @: doesn't work
either.  Matt Wozniski:  nv_at() calls do_execreg() which uses
put_in_typebuf().  Char mapped twice?

Despite adding save_subexpr() this still doesn't work properly:
Regexp: matchlist('12a4aaa', '^\(.\{-}\)\(\%5c\@<=a\+\)\(.\+\)\?')

ftplugin for help file should set 'isk' to help file value.

Win32: remote editing fails when the current directory name contains "[".
