tra flag to do this once, and a flag to keep the existing
    search pattern.
-   Make 'hlsearch' a local/global option, so that it can be disabled in some
    of the windows.
-   Add \%h{group-name}; to search for a specific highlight group.
    Add \%s{syntax-group}; to search for a specific syntax group.
-   Support Perl regexp.  Use PCRE (Perl Compatible RE) package. (Shade)
    Or translate the pattern to a Vim one.
    Don't switch on with an option for typed commands/mappings/functions, it's
    too confusing.  Use "\@@" in the pattern, to avoid incompatibilities.
8   Add a way to access the last substitute text, what is used for ":s//~/".
    Can't use the ~ register, it's already used for drag & drop.
-   Remember flags for backreferenced items, so that "*" can be used after it.
    Check with "\(\S\)\1\{3}". (Hemmerling)
8   Flags that apply to the whole pattern.
    This works for all places where a regexp is used.
    Add "\q" to not store this pattern as the last search pattern?
-   Add flags to search command (also for ":s"?):
    i	ignore case
    I	use case
    p	use Perl regexp syntax (or POSIX?)
    v	use Vi regexp syntax
    f	forget pattern, don't keep it for "n" command
    F   remember pattern, keep it for "n" command
    Perl uses these too:
    e	evaluate the right side as an expression (Perl only)
    m	multiple line expression (we don't need it)
    o	compile only once (Perl only)
    s	single line expression (we don't need it)
    x	extended regexp (we don't need it)
    When used after ":g" command, backslash needed to avoid confusion with the
    following command.
    Add 'searchflags' for default flags (replaces 'gdefault').
-   Add command to display the last used substitute pattern and last used
    pattern. (Margo)  Maybe make it accessible through a register (like "/
    for search string)?
7   Use T-search algorithm, to speed up searching for strings without special
    characters.  See C't article, August 1997.
-   Add 'fuzzycase' option, so that case doesn't matter, and '-' and '_' are
    equivalent (for Unix filenames).
-   Add 'v' flag to search command: enter Visual mode, with the matching text
    as Visual area. (variation on idea from Bertin)
-   Searching: "/this//that/" should find "that" after "this".
-   Add global search commands: Instead of wrapping at the end of the buffer,
    they continue in another buffer.  Use flag after search pattern:
    a	for the next file in the argument list
    f	for file in the buffer list
    w	for file edited in a window.
    e.g. "/pat/f".  Then "n" and "N" work through files too.  "f" flag also for
    ":s/pat/foo/f"???  Then when 'autowrite' and 'hidden' are both not set, ask
    before saving files: "Save modified buffer "/path/file"? (Yes/Hide/No
    Save-all/hide-All/Quit) ".
-   ":s/pat/foo/3": find 3rd match of "pat", like sed. (Thomas Koehler)
7   When searching with 'n' give message when getting back where the search
    first started.  Remember start of search in '/ mark.
7   Add option that scrolls screen to put cursor in middle of screen after
    search always/when off-screen/never.  And after a ":tag" command.  Maybe
    specify how many lines below the screen causes a redraw with the cursor in
    the middle (default would be half a screen, zero means always).
6   Support multiple search buffers, so macros can be made without side
    effects.
7   From xvim: Allow a newline in search patterns (also for :s, can delete
    newline).  Add BOW, EOW, NEWL, NLORANY, NLBUTANY, magic 'n' and 'r', etc.
    [not in xvim:] Add option to switch on matches crossing ONE line boundary.
7   Add ":iselect", a combination of ":ilist" and ":tselect". (Aaron) (Zellner)
    Also ":dselect".


Undo:
9   ":gundo" command: global undo.  Undoes changes spread over multiple files
    in the order they were made.  Also ":gredo".  Both with a count.  Useful
    when tests fail after making changes and you forgot in which files.
9   After undo/redo, in the message show whether the buffer is modified or
    not.
8   Search for pattern in undo tree, showing when it happened and the text
    state, so that you can jump to it.
8   Undo tree: visually show the tree somehow (Damian Conway)
    Show only the leaves, indicating how many changed from the branch and the
    timestamp?
    Put branch with most recent change on the left, older changes get more
    indent?
-   Make it possible to undo all the commands from a mapping, including a
    trailing unfinished command, e.g. for ":map K iX^[r".
-   When accidentally hitting "R" instead of Ctrl-R, further Ctrl-R is not
    possible, even when typing <Esc> immediately. (Grahn)  Also for "i", "a",
    etc.  Postpone saving for undo until something is really inserted?
8   When Inserting a lot of text, it can only be undone as a whole.  Make undo
    sync points at every line or word.  Could recognize the start of a new
    word (white space and then non-white space) and backspacing.
    Can already use CTRL-G u, but that requires remapping a lot of things.
8   Make undo more memory-efficient: Compare text before and after change,
    only remember the lines that really changed.
7   Add undo for a range of lines.  Can change these back to a previous
    version without changing the rest of the file.  Stop doing this when a
    change includes only some of these lines and changes the line count.  Need
    to store these undo actions as a separate change that can be undone.
-   For u_save() include the column number. This can be used to set '[ and '].
    And in the future the undo can be made more efficient (Webb).
-   In out-of-memory situations: Free allocated space in undo, and reduce the
    number of undo levels (with confirmation).
-   Instead of [+], give the number of changes since the last write: [+123].
    When undoing to before the last write, change this to a negative number:
    [-99].
-   With undo with simple line delete/insert: optimize screen updating.
-   When executing macro's: Save each line for undo only once.
-   When doing a global substitute, causing almost all lines to be changed,
    undo info becomes very big.  Put undo info in swap file??


Buffer list:
7   Command to execute a command in another buffer: ":inbuf {bufname} {cmd}".
    Also for other windows: ":inwin {winnr} {cmd}".  How to make sure that
    this works properly for all commands, and still be able to return to the
    current buffer/window?  E.g.: ":inbuf xxx only".
8   Add File.{recent_files} menu entries: Recently edited files.
    Ron Aaron has a plugin for this: mru.vim.
8   Unix: Check all uses of fnamecmp() and fnamencmp() if they should check
    inode too.
7   Add another number for a buffer, which is visible for the user.  When
    creating a new buffer, use the lowest number not in use (or the highest
    number in use plus one?).
7   Offer some buffer selection from the command line?  Like using ":ls" and
    asking for a buffer number. (Zachmann)
-   When starting to edit a file that is already in the buffer list, use the
    file name argument for the new short file name. (Webb)
-   Add an option to make ":bnext" and ":bprev" wrap around the end of the
    buffer list.  Also for ":next" and ":prev"?
7   Add argument to ":ls" which is a pattern for buffers to list.
    E.g. ":ls *.c". (Thompson)
7   Add expansion of buffer names, so that "*.c" is expanded to all buffer
    names.  Needed for ":bdel *.c", ":bunload *.c", etc.
8   Support for <afile> where a buffer name is expected.
7   Add an option to mostly use slashes in file names.  Separately for
    internal use and for when executing an external program?
8   Some file systems are case-sensitive, some are not.  Besides
    'wildignorecase' there might be more parts inside
    CASE_INSENSITIVE_FILENAME that are useful on Unix.


Swap (.swp) files:
8   If writing to the swap file fails, should try to open one in another
    directory from 'dir'.  Useful in case the file system is full and when
    there are short file name problems.
8   Also use the code to try using a short file name for the backup and swap
    file for the Win32 and Dos 32 bit versions.
8   When a file is edited by root, add $LOGNAME to know who did su.
8   When the edited file is a symlink, try to put the swap file in the same
    dir as the actual file.  Adjust FullName().  Avoids editing the same file
    twice (e.g. when using quickfix).  Also try to make the name of the backup
    file the same as the actual file?
    Use the code for resolve()?
7   When using 64 bit inode numbers, also store the top 32 bits.  Add another
    field for this, using part of bo_fname[], to keep it compatible.
7   When editing a file on removable media, should put swap file somewhere
    else.  Use something like 'r' flag in 'viminfo'.  'diravoid'?
    Also: Be able to specify minimum disk space, skip directory when not
    enough room.
7   Add a configure check for which directory should be used: /tmp, /var/tmp
    or /var/preserve.
-   Add an option to create a swap file only when making the first change to
    the buffer.  (Liang)  Or only when the buffer is not read-only.
-   Add option to set "umask" for backup files and swap files (Antwerpen).
    'backupumask' and 'swapumask'?  Or 'umaskback' and 'umaskswap'?
-   When editing a readonly file, don't use a swap file but read parts from the
    original file.  Also do this when the file is huge (>'maxmem').  We do
    need to load the file once to count the number of lines?  Perhaps keep a
    cached list of which line is where.


Viminfo:
7   Can probably remove the code that checks for a writable viminfo file,
    because we now do the chown() for root, and others can't overwrite someone
    else's viminfo file.
8   When there is no .viminfo file and someone does "su", runs Vim, a
    root-owned .viminfo file is created.  Is there a good way to avoid this?
    Perhaps check the owner of the directory.  Only when root?
8   Add argument to keep the list of buffers when Vim is started with a file
    name. (Schild)
8   Keep the last used directory of the file browser (File/Open menu).
8   Remember the last used register for "@@".
8   Remember the redo buffer, so that "." works after restarting.
8   Remember a list of last accessed files.  To be used in the
    "File.Open Recent" menu.  Default is to remember 10 files or so.
    Also remember which files have been read and written.  How to display
    this?
7   Also store the ". register (last inserted text).
7   Make it possible to store buffer names in viminfo file relative to some
    directory, to make them portable over a network.
