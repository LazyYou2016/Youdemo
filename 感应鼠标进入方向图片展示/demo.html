function header, with each argument on its own line.
-   "[p" and "]p" should use 'cindent' code if it's on (only for the first
    line).
-   Add option to 'cindent' to set indent for comments outside of {}?
-   Make a command to line up a comment after a code line with a previous

-   When 'cindent'ing a '}', showmatch is done before fixing the indent.  It

-   Don't use 'cindent' when doing formatting with "gq"?
-   When formatting a comment after some text, insert the '*' for the new line
    (indent is correct if 'cindent' is set, but '*' doesn't get inserted).

    'x' flag always uses the first match.  Need to continue looking for more
    matches of "*" and remember all characters that could end the comment.
-   For smartindent: When typing 'else' line it up with matching 'if'.
-   'smartindent': allow patterns in 'cinwords', for e.g. TeX files, where

-   Support this style of comments (with an o
