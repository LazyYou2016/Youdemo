and "A".  Thus "2dAs"
    deletes the current and previous sentence. (Jens Paulus)
7   Add "g{" and "g}" to move to the first/last character of a paragraph
    (instead of the line just before/after a paragraph as with "{" and "}").
6   Ignore comment leaders for objects.  Make "das" work in reply-email.
5   Make it possible to use syntax group matches as a text object.  For
    example, define a "ccItem" group, then do "da<ccItem>" to delete one.
    Or, maybe just define "dai", delete-an-item, to delete the syntax item the
    cursor is on.


Select mode:
8   In blockwise mode, typed characters are inserted in front of the block,
    backspace deletes a column before the block. (Steve Hall)
7   Alt-leftmouse starts block mode selection in MS Word.
    See http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Use_Alt-Mouse_to_select_blockwise.
7   Add Cmdline-select mode.  Like Select mode, but used on the command line.
    - Change gui_send_mouse_event() to pass on mouse events when 'mouse'
      contains 'C' or 'A'.
    - Catch mouse events in ex_getln.c.  Also shift-cursor, etc., like in
      normal_cmd().
    - remember start and end of selection in cmdline_info.
    - Typing text replaces the selection.


Visual mode:
8   Support using "." in Visual mode. Use the operator applied to the Visual
    selection, if possible.
-   When dragging the Visual selection with the mouse and 'scrolloff' is zero,
    behave like 'scrolloff' is one, so that the text scrolls when the pointer
    is in the top line.
-   Displaying size of Visual area: use 24-33 column display.
    When selecting multiple lines, up to about a screenful, also count the
    characters.
8   When using "I" or "A" in Visual block mode, short lines do not get the new
    text.  Make it possible to add the text to short lines too, with padding
    where needed.
7   With a Visual block selected, "2x" deletes a block of double the width,
    "3y" yanks a block of triple width, etc.
7   When selecting linewise, using "itext" should insert "text" at the start
    of each selected line.
8   What is "R" supposed to do in Visual mode?
8   Make Visual mode local to the buffer.  Allow changing to another buffer.
    When starting a new Visual selection, remove the Visual selection in any
    other buffer. (Ron Aaron)
8   Support dragging the Visual area to drop it somewhere else. (Ron Aaron,
    Ben Godfrey)
7   Support dragging the Visual area to drop it in another program, and
    receive dropped text from another program. (Ben Godfrey)
7   With blockwise Visual mode and "c", "C", "I", "A", etc., allow the use of
    a <CR>.  The entered lines are repeated over the Visual area.
7   Filtering a block should only apply to the block, not to the whole lines.
    When the number of lines is increased, add lines. When decreased, pad with
    spaces or delete? Use ":`<,`>" on the command line.
8   After filtering the Visual area, make "gv" select the filtered text?
    Currently "gv" only selects a single line, not useful.
7   Don't move the cursor when scrolling?  Needed when the selection should
    stay the same.  Scroll to the cursor at any movement command.  With an
    option!
7   In Visual block mode, need to be able to define a corner on a position
    that doesn't have text?  Also: when using the mouse, be able to select
    part of a TAB.  Even more: Add a mode where the cursor can be on a screen
    position where there is no text.  When typing, add spaces to fill the gap.
    Other solution: Always use curswant, so that you can move the cursor to
    the right column, and then use up/down movements to select the line,
    without changing the column.
6   ":left" and ":right" should work in Visual block mode.
7   CTRL-I and CTRL-O should work in Visual mode, but only jump to marks in the
    current buffer.
6   In non-Block mode, "I" should insert the same text in front of each line,
    before the first non-blank, "gI" in column 1.
6   In non-Block mode, "A" should append the same text after each line.
6   When in blockwise visual selection (CTRL-V), allow cursor to be placed
    right of the line.  Could also allow cursor to be placed anywhere on a TAB
    or other special character.
6   Add commands to move selected text, without deselecting.


More advanced repeating commands:
-   Add "." command for visual mode: redo last visual command (e.g. ":fmt").
-   Add command to repeat last movement.  Including count.
-   Add "." command after operator: repeat last command of same operator.  E.g.
    "c." will repeat last change, also when "x" used since then (Webb).
    "y." will repeat last yank.
    "c2." will repeat the last but one change?
    Also: keep history of Normal mode commands, add command to list the history
    and/or pick an older command.
-   History stack for . command?  Use "g." command.


Mappings and Abbreviations:
8   When "0" is mapped (it is a movement c
