  Seek error in swap file write
  Write error in swap file

This mostly happens when the disk is full.  Vim could not write text into the
|swap-file|.  It's not directly harmful, but when Vim unexpectedly exits some
text may be lost without recovery being possible.  Vim might run out of memory
when this problem persists.

						*connection-refused*  >
  Xlib: connection to "<machine-name:0.0" refused by server

This happens when Vim tries to connect to the X server, but the X server does
not allow a connection.  The connection to the X server is needed to be able
to restore the title and for the xterm clipboard support.  Unfortunately this
error message cannot be avoided, except by disabling the |+xterm_clipboard|
and |+X11| features.

  \\ should be followed by /, ? or &

A command line started with a backslash or the range of a command contained a
backslash in a wrong place.  This is often caused by command-line continuation
being disabled.  Remove the 'C' flag from the 'cpoptions' option to enable it.
Or use ":set nocp
